            <p>A Summoner's Tale takes place on a fictional planet named Gaia. Gaia is mainly inhabited by humans, although they share the planet with a plethora of magical creatures. Many thousands of years ago, the first summoner was born. His true identity is lost to the ages, the summoners of today simply refer to him as The Originator. The Originator founded the Order of Summoners, a group dedicated to the protection of Gaia's denizens.</p>

            <p>A Summoner is a human that was born with the innate ability to sense and control the six elements: Light, Dark, Fire, Water, Earth and Air. Each element has its own characteristics, strengths and weaknesses. A summoner usually has their own preference, having an affinity with one of the elements. It is not known how the summoner gains an affinity for one of the elements, however several popular theories attest that it is based on the Summoner's subconscious being. That is, who the Summoner really is within.</p>
