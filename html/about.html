            <p>Blindside games is a start up and currently non profit development team. we started out as a group of gamers who realised we all work in the relevant fields to collaborate and make a game. so our first project was born, we are still in early days with it but we will be distributing through itch.io and posting regular updates via our projects page. As we will with all future projects. We look forward to seeing what you guys think of our game!</p>
