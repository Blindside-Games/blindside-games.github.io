            <p>Blindside games is a start up and currently non profit indie studio. We started out as a group of gamers who
                realised we each had the necessary skills to add to something to the thing we loved. So Blinside Games was
                born! Our first project, A Summoner's Tale, is currently in development. We will be posting regular updates
                via our projects page as well as our itch.io page. We look forward to seeing what you guys think of our game!</p>
